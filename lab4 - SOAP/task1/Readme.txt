The URL for the Task 2 Client is "http://localhost:8080/lab4givenclient/lab4servlet?year=2&subject=History".

The WSDL is modified to support soap fault messages instead of the WSDL fault messages generated by the service. 
The WSDL for the client is placed in the root of the client submission directory - lab4.noletyve - task 2 client

Lab4Service could not be renamed to Lab4-asurite. Only the .aar file is renamed.
